# Convoy Game Of Life
This is implementation of conway's game of life in python.

##About this Game
In 1970 the British Mathematician John Conway created his "Game of Life" -- a set of rules that mimics the chaotic yet patterned growth of a colony of biological organisms. The "game" takes place on a two-dimensional grid consisting of "living" and "dead" cells, and the rules to step from generation to generation are simple:

Overpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies.
Stasis: if a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives.
Underpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies.
Reproduction: if a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.
By enforcing these rules in sequential steps, beautiful and unexpected patterns can appear.
